HOW TO USE THE STANDARD MODEL FILES
------------------------------------------------------

In RobotC, motor and sensor confiuration must be done at the top of every program.
A standard model allows you to create one file that all your programs will draw 
from. When using a standard model, if you wish to change your motor or sensor layout,
you must only change one file; without a standard model, you would have to edit every
single program that you have created.

A standard model has three parts: a C source file with the definition of the con-
figuration that you want for your robot; an RTF text document with a short description
of the parts of your configuration; and finally, a JPG image to display as a thumbnail,
which shows a small picture or drawing of your standard model configuration.

Standard model files are kept in RobotC's program files on your PC. To be able to edit
them easier, you can change the directory in which RobotC will look for the standard
models. To do this, go to View->Preferences->Detailed Preferences->General. Under the
"Directories" tab, change the standard model lookup directory to one of your choosing.
Then, in the directory you chose, create another directory to store the standard model.
We recommend naming it "TETRIX", just to keep in step with RobotC's own conventions.

To create a standard model, follow these instructions.

1.	Create the C source file with your motor and sensor configurations. This should 
	look familiar to you; it has the same layout as the group of #pragma definitions 
	at the top of every RobotC program.	To generate one, go to Robot->Motors and 
	Sensors Setup, or right click an existing motor and sensor definition and click 
	"Edit Motors and Sensors Definition". Either way, use the built-in utility to edit 
	the motors and sensors setup to the configuration you want.
2.	Create an RTF (Rich Text Format) document with a small description of your
	configuration. You can create an RTF document in any word proccessing program.
3. 	Create a JPEG image that visualizes your standard model. This could be a picture
	of your robot, or you could do as we did and just use your team logo.
4.	You must restart RobotC for the standard model to be recognized. Each time you make
	a change, RobotC must be restarted.
5.	Back in RobotC, in your main program, go back to the Motors and Sensors Setup window,
	and go to the Standard Models tab, and select your standard model from the list. 
	Click Apply, and you standard model will be applied.
